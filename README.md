# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark on Windows 10, identify different network protocols, and export the captured packets for analysis.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark 3.2.1 (64-bit)
- Npcap (WinPcap compatible mode)
- Windows 10 (Build 10240)

---

## 📋 Task Performed
1. Installed Wireshark on Windows 10.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging a server.
4. Stopped the capture after one minute.
5. Applied display filters for different protocols.
6. Identified at least three protocols:
   - DNS
   - TCP
   - HTTP
7. Analyzed packet details such as source IP, destination IP, protocol, and packet length.
8. Exported the capture file in `.pcap` format.

## 🔍 Protocols Identified
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **TCP**: Provides reliable data transmission.
- **HTTP**: Handles web communication.

## 📁 Files Included
- `wireshark_capture.pcap` – Captured network traffic file
- `README.md` – Documentation of the task

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic network packet capturing and protocol analysis using Wireshark. It helps in understanding how network communication works at the packet level.
