Network Traffic Capture and Analysis Using Wireshark

2. Objective 

The objective of this experiment is to capture live network traffic using Wireshark, analyze different network protocols, apply protocol-based filters, and export the captured packets for further analysis.

3. System Configuration Operating System: Windows 10 (Build 10240) Processor Architecture: 64-bit Tool Used: Wireshark 3.2.1 (64-bit) Packet Capture Driver: Npcap (WinPcap compatible mode) 4. Software Requirements Wireshark 3.2.1 Npcap (compatible with Windows 10 Build 10240) Internet connection (Wi‑Fi / Ethernet) 5. Procedure Step 1: Installation Downloaded Wireshark 3.2.1 (64-bit) from the official website. Installed Wireshark with default settings. Installed Npcap in WinPcap compatibility mode. Step 2: Starting Packet Capture Launched Wireshark application. Selected the active network interface (Wi‑Fi). Started packet capture by double-clicking the interface. Step 3: Generating Network Traffic Visited websites such as www.google.com. Used the command prompt to ping a server: ping google.com Step 4: Stopping Capture Captured packets for approximately one minute. Stopped the capture using the stop button. Step 5: Filtering Packets 

Applied display filters to analyze specific protocols:

dns tcp http 6. Observations 

The following protocols were identified during packet analysis:

DNS (Domain Name System) Used for resolving domain names to IP addresses. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Used for web communication between client and server. 

Packet details such as source IP address, destination IP address, protocol type, and packet length were observed.

7. Result 

Successfully captured live network traffic, filtered packets based on protocols, analyzed packet details, and exported the captured data as a .pcap file.

8. Conclusion 

This experiment provided hands-on experience with Wireshark for network traffic analysis. It helped in understanding how different protocols operate during normal network communication and how packet-level data can be captured and analyzed.
